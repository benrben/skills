# Fathom

A suite of Claude Code skills built on one principle and one shared model: turn **shallow** modules (interface ≈ as complex as the implementation) into **deep** ones — a lot of behaviour behind a small interface — for the sake of testability and AI-navigability.

The skills don't just analyse; they share a **living architecture model** — the `arch-map` MCP **spine** — that each one reads and writes, so a codebase becomes something humans *and* agents can reason about by depth.

## The principle

Every skill speaks one vocabulary ([LANGUAGE.md](./fathom/LANGUAGE.md)) — **module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage, locality** — and obeys the same rules: the **deletion test** (if a module vanished, would complexity concentrate behind a small interface, or just scatter?), **the interface is the test surface**, and **one adapter = a hypothetical seam, two = a real one**. Architecture is reasoned about by *depth*, never by "components/services/APIs/boundaries."

## The suite

Five skills, one engineer cycle — **map → understand → design → code**, with `review` gating changes. The three writers (`map`, `design`, `code`) never share a slice; the two read-only skills (`understand`, `review`) bookend the loop. All speak one vocabulary and share one model — and all **docs live only on the spine** (no `docs/` files), in eleven types ([DOC-TYPES.md](./fathom/DOC-TYPES.md)). The **task board** ([BOARD.md](./fathom/BOARD.md)) makes that cycle trackable — one column per skill, one worktree per task.

- [`map`](./skills/map/SKILL.md) — observe & record what the codebase IS: modules, depth, edges, leaks, coverage, **all** signals — and capture the recorded truth around it as docs of every type (glossary, note, risk, runbook, postmortem, diagram, and the adr for a decision baked into the code). The doc **registrar** (absorbs the old `adr-writer`) and keeper of worktree truth.
- [`understand`](./skills/understand/SKILL.md) — a read-only guided tour of the map, **its docs**, and **the work in flight** on the board (entry interfaces, deepest modules, leak hot-spots, active tasks/agents/worktrees), ending with the named next action. The front door; writes nothing. Explains the **understand** column.
- [`design`](./skills/design/SKILL.md) — decide the deep structure, two modes by request: **improve** an existing shallow module (flag a candidate, grill it) or design **new** intended structure (seams, interfaces, sequenced steps). Writes candidates, intended modules, Plans, and rfc/spec/adr/diagram docs. Merges the old `deepen` + `plan`. Owns the **plan** column — sequences each step as a board task with its own worktree.
- [`code`](./skills/code/SKILL.md) — execute a chosen target (refactor shallow→deep, build to a planned interface, or write interface tests), following [MINIMALISM.md](./fathom/MINIMALISM.md), **inside the task's own git worktree**. The **only** skill that edits source. Owns the **in-progress** column.
- [`review`](./skills/review/SKILL.md) — review a diff/PR (often a task's worktree branch) **through the map**: modules touched, seams crossed, danger-zones touched without tests, interface erosion. Read-only (may record a `risk`/`postmortem` doc, and move the card); the change gate. Owns the **review** column.

## The spine: `arch-map`

The suite ships a [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) server at [`arch-map/`](./fathom/arch-map/) — the persistent model every skill reads and writes. The agent keeps it current with a small tool surface (`archmap_show_map`, `archmap_scan_signals`, `archmap_board`, and six action-dispatchers — `archmap_modules`, `archmap_suggestions`, `archmap_grilling`, `archmap_plans`, `archmap_docs`, `archmap_worktrees` — e.g. `archmap_suggestions(action="flag", …)`, `archmap_worktrees(action="create", …)`) and a UI-capable host renders it inline via [MCP Apps](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-01-26-mcp-apps/): depth = node fill, coverage = ring, suggestions = ⚠ ring, leaks = red edge, orphans = a "not connected" tray — plus the **task board** (the Graph ↔ Board toggle). Registered for this repo in [`.mcp.json`](./.mcp.json). See the [arch-map README](./fathom/arch-map/README.md).

## The task board & per-task worktrees

The same spine projects every Plan's WorkSteps into a **task board** — a Kanban whose **columns are the skill cycle** (`todo · understand · plan · in-progress · review · done`, each column owned by a skill) and whose **rows are the agents** carrying each task. A card can be built in its own **git worktree** — an isolated branch — so several tasks (and the agents on them) run in parallel without colliding. The board is the cycle made *trackable*: a card flows left→right, its agent and worktree travelling with it. It's not a sixth skill — it's spine state + a studio surface the five skills drive (`archmap_board`, `archmap_worktrees`, and `archmap_plans` steps). In the studio a header **Graph ↔ Board** toggle (`b`) swaps the graph for the board; drag a card to move its stage, ＋ a worktree, ▶ dispatch an agent into it. Real `git worktree` work is ON by default and guarded like `/api/dispatch` (same-origin + `ARCH_MAP_ALLOW_WORKTREE`); see [BOARD.md](./fathom/BOARD.md).

## Keep the map true: measured facts, drift, and the weekly pulse

The spine measures its own facts instead of trusting estimates. `archmap_ingest(map, root=…)` computes **churn** from git history, **coverage** from a real test report (coverage.py XML/JSON or lcov), and **size** (implementation mass) from each module's measured LOC — normalized so 1.0 is the median module, which is what the `bulky-impl` signal reads — and records a reconcile **anchor** (git sha + per-module health snapshot). From there:

- `archmap_drift(map)` — what changed since the last anchor; the map digest (`archmap_show_map`) opens with the same staleness line ("3 files changed, 2 modules touched since `a1b2c3d`").
- `archmap_history(map)` — health/depth/coverage trends across anchors, per module or per domain.
- `archmap_verify_edges(map)` — the recorded dependency edges checked against the code's real imports.

**Weekly health pulse** — schedule a recurring agent that keeps watch and reports, writing nothing:

```
/schedule weekly: run archmap_drift and archmap_scan_signals on the <map> map,
compare archmap_history against last week, and report: stale modules, signals
entered/left, and the health trend. Report only — do not write the spine.
```

(Locally, the same prompt works with `/loop` or any cron runner pointed at `claude -p`.) Routine reconciles stay with `/map`; the pulse only tells you when one is due.

## Install it in another project

This repo is a self-contained Claude Code **plugin + marketplace** (`fathom`). Installing it brings **all five skills _and_ the `arch-map` MCP spine** in one step.

**Prerequisite:** [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on your `PATH` (the MCP server runs via `uv run`).

```bash
cd /path/to/your/other-project
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/benrben/fathom      # or a local clone: /path/to/fathom
/plugin install fathom@benrben
```

That gives you:

- **The skills** — the slash commands `/map`, `/understand`, `/design`, `/code`, `/review` (auto-registered from the plugin; `SKILL.md` edits hot-reload).
- **The spine** — the `arch-map` MCP server auto-registers from the plugin's [`.mcp.json`](./.mcp.json), which uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` so it resolves to wherever the plugin is installed. Approve it when prompted. The first launch runs `uv`, which bootstraps the server's venv from its lockfile (needs network once; or pre-run `uv sync` in the installed `…/fathom/arch-map`). MCP/hook changes need `/reload-plugins` to take effect.

The spine is **multi-map**, so a single install serves *every* project — each gets its own map keyed by project name (stored under the plugin's `arch-map/maps/`).

**Just the living map (no skills):** register only the MCP, from any project, with an absolute path:

```bash
claude mcp add arch-map -- uv run --project /Users/benreich/skills/fathom/arch-map arch-map
```

**Developing in *this* repo:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is only set when the plugin is installed, so the bundled `.mcp.json` won't auto-launch arch-map when this repo is opened directly. For local dev, run it explicitly — `uv run --project fathom/arch-map arch-map` (stdio) or `… arch-map.web` (browser studio at `http://127.0.0.1:8800/`).
